## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[Although the coding aspect of the project was quite interesting and more or less direct, uploading the project from glitch into github was more difficult for me. Since I did not initially have the proper apps in order to correctly follow the directions in the video, it took a few tries before I received the optimal result. Additionally, since I added additional buttons, I had some trouble as to how I could add sound to those buttons; the resulting error I received was due to syntax error. After looking at the code more carefully though, I was able to figure out the syntax problem.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[The questions I have regarding web development have to do with if html is required in this field. Since I have some experience with java and c++, the html language appeared to be a little more difficult. Additionally, I am curious as to how to add specific and unique sounds, rather than the tunes that were used in this project. I also want to know how to add images and if it is possible to add gifs for projects like these. Lastly, I am wondering if it is possible to add certain colors to the code that are not already built in.]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[If I had a few more hours to work on this project, I would want to add confetti to the screen when the user won the game. Additionally, I would want to change the shape of some of the buttons to perhaps a star or another shape. Also, I would find it interesting if there was an option to choose the user difficulty, where increasing difficulty would result in less time and more colors to follow.]
